# 8-bit Pixel Art Themed Potfolio Website

Made using HTML and CSS from scratch. Image Sources are pinterest and google images, I own none of the assets. Website was made as practice inspired from the exercise in Angela Yu's Web Development 2020 Web Development Bootcamp. 

# Techniques Used:

1. CSS Centering (a lot of it)
2. CSS Flexbox
3. HTML forms, redirects
4. Inserting images and GIFs
5. Importing fonts
